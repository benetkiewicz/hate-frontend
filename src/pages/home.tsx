      <h1>Blog about Front End development</h1>
      <h2>(and hating it)</h2>
      <p>
        I have a confession: I'm not a fan of front-end development. To me, it
        feels like navigating through a maze of oddly named tools, facing
        gargantuan and often meaningless exception stack traces, and wrestling
        with an endless sea of package dependencies. Don't even get me started
        on the unit test conventions, which seem to be designed to test one's
        patience rather than the code. And TypeScript? Its syntax spirals into
        indecipherability so quickly that you need to slap on Prettier, only to
        make things more convoluted. It's as if there's a new library trending
        every month, each claiming to be the panacea for all front-end ailments.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here I am, a self-proclaimed aspiring full-stack developer with a
        heart rooted deeply in the back-end world, where logic reigns supreme,
        and everything feels simpler, more orderly, and, frankly, civilized.
        This blog is a haven for my fellow full-stack developers who share a
        similar disdain for the front-end chaos, and for the back-end wizards
        who, by fate or misfortune, find themselves needing to dabble in
        front-end sorcery.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a dedicated front-end developer, I suggest you look away now.
        Your presence here might just add another thirteen microbytes to your
        package size, and we wouldn't want that, would we?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, let's take a deep breath and dive into this together. Who knows, we
        might just find some method to this madness after all.
