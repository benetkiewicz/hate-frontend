      <h1>Blog about Front End development</h1>
      <h2>(and hating it)</h2>
      <p>
        I have a confession: I&apos;m not a fan of front-end development. To me, it
        feels like navigating through a maze of oddly named tools, facing
        gargantuan and often meaningless exception stack traces, and wrestling
        with an endless sea of package dependencies. Don&apos;t even get me started
        on the unit test conventions, which seem to be designed to test one&apos;s
        patience rather than the code. And TypeScript? Its syntax spirals into
        indecipherability so quickly that you need to slap on Prettier, only to
        make things more convoluted. It&apos;s as if there&apos;s a new library trending
        every month, each claiming to be the panacea for all front-end ailments.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here I am, a self-proclaimed aspiring full-stack developer with a
        heart rooted deeply in the back-end world, where logic reigns supreme,
        and everything feels simpler, more orderly, and, frankly, civilized.
        This blog is a haven for my fellow full-stack developers who share a
        similar disdain for the front-end chaos, and for the back-end wizards
        who, by fate or misfortune, find themselves needing to dabble in
        front-end sorcery.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you&apos;re a dedicated front-end developer, I suggest you look away now.
        Your presence here might just add another thirteen microbytes to your
        package size, and we wouldn&apos;t want that, would we?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, let&apos;s take a deep breath and dive into this together. Who knows, we
        might just find some method to this madness after all.
